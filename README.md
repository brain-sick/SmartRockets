# SmartRockets
Rockets move to a target and evolve using genetic algorithm

A target is specified and a population of rockets is initialized. An obstacle is placed in the path between the starting position of rockets and the target.
The population of rockets evolve using genetic algorithm and in each consecutive generation their maximum fitness score increases and more and more rockets reach the target.
